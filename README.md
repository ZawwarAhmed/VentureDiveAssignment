   This task is to evaluate your understanding of loops in JavaScript. Write a program that contains a variable named "limit", which will be a positive number, the program should then print even numbers from 0 up to the number defined in "limit".
   Example: If the limit is set to 10, the program should output the following: 0 2 4 6 8 10

2. BMI calculator
   Body Mass Index is a simple calculation using a person's height and weight. The formula for calculating BMI is `weight / height ^ 2`. Here, the weight is in Kg and the height is in metres. All the values used in your program must be assigned to appropriate variables. Your program should print the calculated BMI.

3. Grade Assignment
   You've been given a task to assign grade to score obtained by your student. For any student, grade depends upon how they score. Please refer to the chart below for grade and score criteria. Your program should have a function to calculate and return the grade based on the input provided as a paremeter.
   Example: If the score is 76, the program should output the following: A-

   | Grade | Score    |
   | ----- | -------- |
   | A+    | 85 - 100 |
   | A     | 80 - 84  |
   | A-    | 75 - 79  |
   | B+    | 70 - 74  |
   | B     | 65 - 69  |
   | B-    | 60 - 64  |
   | C     | 50 - 59  |
   | F     | 0 - 50   |
